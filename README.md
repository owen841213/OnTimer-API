## OnTimer APIs
These are all the APIs used in OnTimer APP. The schema of the database is also contained in the webpage.

## Getting started
The usage of all APIs and their functions are shown in the web page.

In order to make them work, you'll need to build a webserver and a database server manually. Through the webserver, you will be able to access the data in your database with API URLs.

For example, the URL "http://ontimer-server-dev.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/events?userid={userid}" will return the information of the first ten meetings of a user.
